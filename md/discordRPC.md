you have to make a discord dev account to do this. I don't make the rules.

Afterwords, go to [https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications).  
Make a new application.  
![newApp](img/newApp.png)

Add a cover image and the image you want as the RPC underneath.
![richPresence](img/richPresence.png)

then replace "DiscordRPC" in pack.json with your clientID.  
![CLIENT](img/CLIENT.png)

It should just work from there(?)  
I should really test this out but I'm lazy atm someone look into it pls.
